**`SizePolicy`**

Specifies how the bucket array grows and the algorithm used for determining the position
of an element with hash value `h` in the array.
* `prime_size`: Sizes are prime numbers in an approximately doubling sequence. `position(h) = h % size`,
modulo operations are sped up by keeping a function pointer table with `fpt[i](h) == h % size(i)`,
where `i` ranges over the size sequence.
* `prime_switch_size`: Same as before, but instead of a table a `switch` statement over `i` is used.
* `prime_fmod_size`: `position(h) = fastmod(high32bits(h) + low32bits(h), size)`.
[fastmod](https://github.com/lemire/fastmod) is a fast implementation of modulo for 32-bit numbers
by Daniel Lemire.
* `prime_frng_size`: `position(h) = fastrange(h, size)`. Daniel Lemire's [fastrange](https://github.com/lemire/fastrange)
maps a uniform distribution of values in the range `[0, size)`. This policy is ill behaved for
low quality hash functions because it ignores the low bits of the hash value.
* `prime_frng_fib_size`: Fixes pathological situations of `prime_frng_size` by doing
`positon(h) = fastrange(h * F, size)`, where `F` is the
[Fibonacci hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function#Fibonacci_hashing) constant.
* `pow2_size`: Sizes are consecutive powers of two. `position(h)` returns the higher bits of the
hash value, which, as it happens with `prime_frng_size`, works poorly for low quality hash functions.
* `pow2_fib_size`: `h` is Fibonacci hashed before calculating the position.

**`BucketArrayPolicy`**
* `simple_buckets`: The bucket array is a plain vector of node pointers without additional metadata.
The resulting container deviates from the C++ standard requirements for unordered associative
containers in three aspects:
  * Iterator increment is not constant but gets slower as the number of empty buckets grow;
    see [N2023](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n2023.pdf) for details.
  * Because of the former, `erase(iterator)` returns `void` instead of an iterator to the next
    element.
  * `begin()` is not constant time (hopping to the first occupied bucket is required).
<div style="list-style-type: none;margin-left: 40px;">
  <ul>This policy is used to simulate <code>unordered_bucket_map</code> as specified in the
    <a href="https://pdimov.github.io/articles/unordered_dev_plan.html">Development Plan for Boost.Unordered</a>.
  </ul>
</div>

* `bcached_simple_buckets`: Same as `simple_buckets`, but a reference to the first occupied bucket
is kept and updated so as to provide constant-time `begin()`.
* `grouped_buckets`: The resulting container is fully standards-compliant, including constant
iteration and average constant `erasure(iterator)`. Besides the usual bucket array, a vector
of *bucket group* metadata is kept. Buckets are logically grouped in 32/64 (depending on the
architecture) consecutive buckets: the associated bucket group metadata consists of a pointer
to the first bucket of the group, a bitmask signalling which buckets are occupied,
and `prev` and `next` pointers to link non-empty bucket groups in a bidirectional list.
Going from a given bucket to the next occupied one is implemented as follows:
  * Use [bit counting](https://www.boost.org/libs/core/doc/html/core/bit.html) operations to
    determine, in constant time, the following occupied bucket within the group.
  * If there are no further occupied buckets in the group, go the `next` group (which is
    guaranteed to be non-empty).
<div style="list-style-type: none;margin-left: 40px;">
  <ul>The memory overhead added by bucket groups is 4 bits per bucket.</ul>
</div>

**`NodeAllocationPolicy`**
* `dynamic_node_allocation`: Nodes are allocated individually.
* `hybrid_node_allocation`: Buckets are extended to hold space for a node. When inserting
a new value in a bucket, that bucket and its three neighbors to the right are checked for
available embedded space to hold the node; if no space is found, dynamic allocation is used.
The resulting container deviates in a number of important aspects from the C++ standard
requirements for unordered associative containers:
  * Pointer stability is not mantained on rehashing.
  * The elements of the container must be movable.
  * It is not possible to provide [node extraction](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/node_handle)
  capabilities.
* `linear_node_allocation`: Nodes are preallocated in a linear array and selected with
quadratic probing using an occupancy bitmask. Same deviations from the C++ standard as
`hybrid_node_allocation`.
* `pool_node_allocation`: Nodes are preallocated in a linear array and selected
incrementally as requested (with recycling of erased nodes). Same deviations from the
C++ standard as `hybrid_node_allocation`.
* `embedded_node_allocation`: Nodes are embedded into the buckets like in
`hybrid_node_allocation`, but no dynamic allocation happens ever: selection is done
through quadratic probing using the same technique as `linear_node_allocation`.

Containers based on [coalesced hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalesced_hashing)
The implementation follows [Vitter's original formulation](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.119.6552&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
with some innovations in the area of node recycling:
* A *cellar* (extra node reservoir) is provided with an address factor
(nodes reachable by hash divided by total number of nodes allocated) *Î²* = 0.86.
* Insertion into a chain happens after the initial element or, if cellar nodes are traversed,
after the last cellar node in the chain (Vitter's VICH Varied-Insertion Coalesced Hashing
algorithm).
* Nodes of erased elements are unlinked and recycled if they are not at the beginning
of a (sub)chain. In particular, erased cellar nodes are always recycled.

The resulting container deviates in a number of important aspects from the C++ standard
requirements for unordered associative containers:

* Pointer stability is not mantained on rehashing.
* The elements of the container must be movable.
* It is not possible to provide [node extraction](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/node_handle)
capabilities.
* Iterator increment is not constant but gets slower as the number of non-occupied nodes grow.
* Because of the former, `erase(iterator)` returns `void` instead of an iterator to the next
  element.
* `begin()` is not constant time (hopping to the first occupied node is required).
* `erase(iterator)` is implemented as `erase(*iterator)`: this will throw if `Hash` or `Pred` do,
but allows for node recycling.
* Rehashing does not happen when the number of elements in the container hits the maximum load,
but when the number of *used* nodes do; for instance, erasing an element at the beginning of
its chain won't get its node recycled, so in this case the number of used nodes does not
decrease. This behavior makes it hard to predict exactly when rehashing will occur in the
presence of erasures.
  
**`SizePolicy`**

As with [`fca_unordered_set`/`fca_unordered_map`](#fca_unordered_*).

**`NodePolicy`**
* `simple_coalesced_set_nodes`: Regular nodes are used with storage for the value and a `next` pointer.
* `hcached_coalesced_set_nodes`: Nodes are extended to keep the hash value of the element; hash
comparison is used to rule out non-matches on lookup without invoking the equality predicate,
which can potentially speed up the process.

```cpp
template<
  typename T,typename Hash=boost::hash<T>,typename Pred=std::equal_to<T>,
  typename Allocator=std::allocator<T>
>
class fca_simple_unordered_set;

template<

  typename Hash=boost::hash<Key>,typename Pred=std::equal_to<Key>,
  typename Allocator=std::allocator</* equivalent to std::pair<const Key,Value> */>

```

Abandoned experiment where individual occupied buckets where linked in a bidirectional
list. Outperformed by `fca_unordered_[set|map]` with `grouped_buckets`.
